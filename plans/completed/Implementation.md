## 🏗️ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Backend (FastAPI)

**Technology Stack:**

- FastAPI 0.100+ with async support
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 with PostgreSQL
- Pydantic v2 for data validation
- Alembic for database migrations
- JWT authentication (planned)

**Current Status:** Models and basic structure complete, needs API routes

### Frontend (React + Vite)

**Technology Stack:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling (instead of Next.js)
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Hook Form for form handling

**Current Status:** Complete UI implementation with mock data, needs backend integration

### Key Architecture Changes from Original Plan:

1. **Frontend Framework:** Chose React + Vite instead of Next.js for simplicity
2. **Component Library:** Used shadcn/ui instead of custom components
3. **Charts:** Recharts implemented instead of Chart.js or Plotly
4. **Mobile-First:** Already implemented in current frontend

## 🎯 TO MAKE FUNCTIONAL (Critical Path)

### Immediate Blockers (Must Complete):

1. **Database Setup** - Run migrations and establish DB connection
2. **API Routes** - Implement CRUD endpoints for data operations
3. **Frontend Integration** - Connect React app to FastAPI backend
4. **Basic Auth** - Simple user system to test end-to-end flow

### Success Criteria for "Functional":

- ✅ User can log feeding data via frontend
- ✅ Data persists to PostgreSQL database
- ✅ User can view historical data and basic analytics
- ✅ Basic authentication protects user data

**Estimated Time to Functional:** 1-2 weeks of focused development
